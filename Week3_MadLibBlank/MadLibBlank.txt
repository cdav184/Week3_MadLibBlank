Mike is CRAZY because it is gameday! 
He started RUNNING with friends and family at the Tailgate.
They were all wearing DRESSES for the game. As the game approached Mike WALKED towards the stadium. 
He gets in the stadium and buys a COKE. 
Mike finds his seat and is CALM for the game to start.
Mike loves the Tigers because they are so ENERGETIC. 
They are playing the PURPLE BALLOON. 
Obviously the Tigers win, and Mike RUNS QUICKLY!
